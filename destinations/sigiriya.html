                <h1>ABOUT THE PLACE</h1>
                <p>
                    Sigiriya is one of the most valuable historical monuments of Sri Lanka. Referred by locals as the Eighth Wonder of the World, this ancient palace and fortress complex has significant archaeological importance and attracts thousands of tourists annually. It is probably the most visited tourist destination in Sri Lanka.

                    <br>
                    Sigiriya rock plateau, formed from the magma of an extinct volcano, is 200 meters higher than the surrounding jungles. Its view astonishes the visitors with the unique harmony between nature and human imagination.

                The fortress complex includes remnants of a ruined palace, surrounded by an extensive network of fortifications, vast gardens, ponds, canals, alleys, and fountains.

                The surrounding territories of Sigiriya were inhibited for several thousand years. Since the 3rd century BC, the rocky plateau of Sigiriya has served as a monastery. In the second half of the 5th-century king, Kasyapa constructed a royal residence here.

                After his death, Sigiriya again became a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century, when it was abandoned.<br><br>

                        The main entrance is located on the northern side of the rock. It was designed as a huge stone lion whose feet have survived until today, but the upper parts of the body were destroyed.

                Thanks to this lion, the palace was named Sigiriya. The term Sigiriya originates from the word Sihagri, i.e., Lion Rock.

                The western wall of Sigiriya was almost entirely covered by frescoes created during the reign of Kasyapa. Eighteen frescoes have survived to this day.

                The frescoes depict nude females and are considered to be either portraits of Kashyapaâ€™s wives and concubines or priestesses performing religious rituals. Despite the unknown identity of the females depicted in the frescoes, these unique ancient paintings celebrate female beauty and have incredible historical significance.

                One of the most striking features of Sigiriya is its Mirror wall. In the old days, it was polished so thoroughly that the king could see his reflection. The Mirror wall is painted with inscriptions and poems written by the visitors of Sigiriya.

                The most ancient inscriptions are dated from the 8th century. These inscriptions prove that Sigiriya was a tourist destination over a thousand years ago. Today, painting on the wall is strictly prohibited.
