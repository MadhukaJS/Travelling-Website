                <h1>ABOUT THE PLACE</h1>
                <p>
                    Trincomalee is a great little town on the east coast of Sri Lanka. Trincomalee offers beautiful white sand and has one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka. The east coast is upcoming and is way quieter than the south, which is a perfect reason to plan a visit. Trincomalee is surrounded by wildlife, hilltops, and rock formations. Take about 2 or 3 full days in this town because there are quite some great things to do in Trincomalee.<br>
                    <h3>Nilaveli Beach</h3><br>
                    Rent a motorbike for your whole stay (±1500 LKR per day) and go explore the nearby beaches. The east coast is much quieter than other parts, so driving here on a motorbike isn’t a problem.<br>
                    <h3>Whale Watching</h3>
                    Trincomalee is famous for Whale Watching. Which is also one of the popular things to do in Mirissa in the opposite season. The whale season in Trincomalee runs from March until August.
                    <h3>Chill at Fernandos</h3>
                    One of the most laid-back bars in town is Fernando’s. Located right on the beach, this chill-out bar offers some good drinks and music. Enjoy the last moments of the sunset in a hammock. Just skip lunch or dinner here, and go to one of these restaurants in Trincomalee.
                    <h3>Visit Sri Pathrakali Amman Kovil</h3>
                    This beautifully colored Hindu temple is located in town and easy to visit. It even might be your lucky day to experience a real ceremony.
